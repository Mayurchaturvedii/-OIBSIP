        <h2>About Bhagat Singh</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh was one of the most prominent figures in India’s freedom movement and is best known for his role in the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly building in New Delhi on March 9, 1919. Singh was also a leader of the Hindutva movement, which advocated for Hindu-specific laws and defended the Sri Ram temple in Ayodhya. Born to a Sikh family on October 27, 1907, Singh grew up witnessing first-hand discrimination against Hindus by Muslims and Christians.
            After graduating from college with honors, he went on to join the Indian National Congress party and became involved in protests British rule. In 1934, Singh was sentenced to death for conspiring to overthrow British rule but was released after two years due to public pressure. He returned to activism and helped organize an armed uprising against British authorities in 1944 but was again arrested and imprisoned until his execution at Phulpur prison on February 19, 1947. Bhagat Singh’s life speaks volumes about India’s struggle for independence as well as its ongoing battle between religious groups.</p>
